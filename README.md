This is a work-in-progress Game Boy emulator.

Currently, the CPU and the timer are emulated and have been tested using Blargg's cpu_instrs tests.
All of the tests pass.

To build the emulator in a Unix-like environment:
* First, ensure that pkg-config and SDL2 are installed.
* Then, enter `make` on the command line.
